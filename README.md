# Port-Scanner
Port scanner in python.

## Requirements
- Linux distribution or windows
- Python 3 


## Installation

>For Linux:
```bash
apt update
apt install git
git clone https://github.com/Mohammad-Shoab/Port-Scanner.git
```
>For windows:
we need to download the zip file and extract it.

## Usage

- For Linux: Type ```python3 port_scanner.py (ip)``` to run the tool.
- For windows: Open cmd at file location & Type ```python3 port_scanner.py (ip)``` to run the tool.

(we have to put ip without bracket like python3 port_scanner.py 127.0.x.x)

## Note

In the port scanner.py file, I had configured the port from 50 to 85 by default, but you may alter it to suit your needs.
